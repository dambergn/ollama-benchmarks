## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant in physics and is denoted by the letter \(c\). It is
approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s), which can also be expressed as:

\[ c \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ meters per second} \]

This value is not dependent on any medium; in a vacuum, light travels at this constant speed. However, the speed
of light does change when it passes through different media such as water, glass, or other transparent substances
due to the phenomenon known as refraction.

The constancy and high speed of light play crucial roles in various fields including astronomy, quantum mechanics,
and general relativity. For example, in astronomy, the time it takes for light from distant stars to reach Earth
can be used to determine the distance to those stars (the light travel time).

Understanding the speed of light is also fundamental to the definition of units like the meter and second, based
on the frequency of a specific atomic transition in caesium-133.

In summary, the speed of light is an essential concept that bridges many areas of science and technology.
