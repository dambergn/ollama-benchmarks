## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s). This constant value
indicates how fast electromagnetic waves travel through empty space without any medium.

In more everyday terms, we often refer to this as "the speed of light" when it comes to describing something that
travels at the fastest rate possible under known physical laws. For instance:

- When someone says, "The internet is 1 gigabit per second," they're using a measure related to how fast
information can move through data networks.
- In sports like track and field events where speed measurements are common, athletes often aim for speeds around
this value in certain races.

However, it's important to note that light does not travel at the same rate under different conditions or
substances. For example:
- It travels a bit slower (about 670,610 kilometers per second) through water.
- In air, its speed is about 300,000 kilometers per second.

Understanding these variations helps us appreciate that light's speed is not constant and can change depending on
the environment it's moving through.
