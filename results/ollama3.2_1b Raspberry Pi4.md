## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics that plays a crucial role in understanding various
phenomena, from the nature of space and time to the behavior of particles and waves.

The speed of light (c) is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s). It's the fastest speed at which any
object or information can travel in a vacuum. This speed limit applies universally, regardless of the motion of
the objects or the medium through which they are traveling.

To put this speed into perspective:

* The fastest human-made object to reach space was the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger, which reached a top speed of
around 27,400 km/h (17,000 mph) during its flight.
* The fastest particle accelerator experiment, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), achieved a record speed of about
99.9999991% of the speed of light in 2019.
* Even at the edge of the observable universe, light travels at an incredible 299,792 km/s.

The speed of light is also important for understanding phenomena like:

* Time dilation: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time appears to pass slower near massive
objects or when traveling at high speeds.
* Relativistic mass: As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases due to the increased energy
required to accelerate it further.
* Wave-particle duality: Light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how it's observed.

The speed of light is a cornerstone of modern physics, and its measurement has been extensively verified through
various experiments.
