## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This value has been determined through
extensive testing and measurements using various technologies and methods.

It's important to note that while the exact speed of light can be measured with great accuracy, it's not a
constant velocity that applies to all systems or environments. In space, such as in outer space, the speed of
light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (about 186,282 miles per hour). In Earth's orbit around the
Sun, the speed at which a satellite travels can be slightly higher.

The accuracy of this measurement depends on various factors such as atmospheric conditions, gravitational
influence, and other physical phenomena. For example, in extreme space environments like deep space or near the
edge of our solar system, the actual speed of light might deviate slightly from the measured value due to these
external factors.

So, while we can say that the speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, it's an average and
may not be the exact value in all environments or situations.
