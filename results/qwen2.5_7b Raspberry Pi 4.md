## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is one of the most fundamental constants in physics and plays a
crucial role in various fields including electromagnetism, optics, and special relativity. It is
denoted by the letter \( c \) and has an exact defined value:

\[ c = 299,792,458 \text{ meters per second} \]

This value was established by the International Committee for Weights and Measures in 2019 as a
result of changes to the definitions of SI base units. The speed of light is exactly defined
because it serves as the reference point for defining the meter, which is now based on the
distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a specific fraction of a second.

In other media, such as water or glass (optical fibers), the speed of light is slower due to the
refractive index of these materials. The general relationship between the speed of light in a
vacuum and its speed through another medium \( n \) (where \( n \) is the refractive index of that
medium) can be expressed by:

\[ v = \frac{c}{n} \]

where \( v \) is the speed of light in the medium.

The speed of light is not only a constant but also has profound implications for our understanding
of time and space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, as an object
approaches the speed of light, its mass increases and time dilation occurs, meaning that time
appears to slow down from the perspective of an observer at rest relative to the moving object.

Understanding the speed of light is crucial in many areas of science and technology, including
communication through fiber optics, GPS satellite navigation systems, and various applications in
astronomy.
