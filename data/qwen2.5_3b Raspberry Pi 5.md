## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s), or about 670,616,629 miles
per hour (mph). This value was first determined by Albert A. Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887, although the
precise value had been theorized much earlier.

One of the most fascinating aspects of light is that it travels at this specific speed limit in the universe. No
other form of electromagnetic radiation or matter can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. The
constancy and universality of the speed of light is a cornerstone of Albert Einstein's theory of special
relativity, published in 1905.

It's important to note that while this is the maximum speed at which information can be transmitted, it does not
affect the motion or travel speed of objects other than light. For example, an object with mass cannot reach the
speed of light because as its velocity approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases, requiring
more energy to continue accelerating.

In addition to traveling at this incredible speed in a vacuum, light also travels through various mediums like air
and water. In these mediums, it slows down due to interactions with particles or vibrations within the medium.
However, because the speed of light is so fast, it's still incredibly difficult for us to detect changes in its
velocity when passing through different materials.

Understanding the speed of light has implications far beyond just a fundamental property of natureâ€”it also plays a
critical role in our technological advances, from fiber-optic communications and data transmission to GPS systems.
