## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,000 miles per second). This value is denoted by the letter "c" and
is a fundamental constant in physics known as the speed of light.

Here are some key points about the speed of light:

1. **Exact Value**: The exact value to which it is defined today is 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s).

2. **Fundamental Constant**: In most scientific contexts, this speed is considered a fundamental constant and does not vary.

3. **Role in Physics**: It plays a crucial role in many areas of physics:
   - **Special Relativity**: Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity states that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant for all observers,
regardless of their relative motion.
   - **Electromagnetic Radiation**: In electromagnetic fields, such as light waves, it defines the relationship between wavelength and frequency (c = λν).

4. **Measurement**: The value was determined by a team at the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1983 based on atomic
clocks using cesium atoms to define time intervals.

5. **Speed Limit for Massless Particles**: Light is both massless and travels at this speed, but it's worth noting that not all particles can travel this
fast. Only photons (particles of light) have exactly the speed of light in vacuum.

6. **Relativistic Effects**: At high speeds approaching the speed of light, relativistic effects become more pronounced, such as time dilation and length
contraction. These phenomena are a consequence of how the laws of physics must be consistent when viewed from different inertial frames of reference
(according to Einstein's special relativity).

Understanding these points can help in grasping its significance across various scientific disciplines and everyday contexts.
