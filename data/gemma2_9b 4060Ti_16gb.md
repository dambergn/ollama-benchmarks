## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum, often denoted by the letter 'c', is a fundamental constant in physics.

Here's what you need to know:

* **Value:** It's exactly 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately 186,282 miles per second).
* **Constant:** The speed of light is constant throughout the universe, meaning it doesn't change regardless of the observer's motion or the light source's
motion. This was a revolutionary concept proposed by Einstein and is a cornerstone of modern physics.
* **Universal Speed Limit:**  Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This is a fundamental limit set by the laws of physics.

**Why is it so important?**

* **Foundation of Special Relativity:** Einstein's theory of special relativity is based on the postulate that the speed of light is constant for all
observers. This leads to mind-bending consequences like time dilation and length contraction.
* **Electromagnetism:** Light is an electromagnetic wave, meaning it's a combination of electric and magnetic fields oscillating at incredibly high
frequencies. The speed of light determines how these waves propagate.
* **Cosmology:**  The speed of light plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe's age, size, and expansion rate. It allows us to measure
distances to distant objects based on the time it takes for light to reach us.

**Fun Fact:**

Light takes about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth.
