## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s). This value was determined 
through experiments and has been widely accepted as a fundamental constant in physics.

Here are some key points regarding the speed of light:

1. **Universal Constant**: The speed of light in a vacuum is considered one of the most important constants 
in all of science, not just physics. It appears in many areas of theoretical physics, including 
electromagnetism and relativity.

2. **Speed Limit for Everything**: According to Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, no 
information or matter can travel faster than the speed of light (c). This has significant implications for 
our understanding of space, time, and gravity.

3. **Relativistic Effects**: As objects approach the speed of light, their mass increases according to the 
famous equation \( E=mc^2 \) formulated by Albert Einstein. At very high speeds, this effect becomes 
noticeable.

4. **Speed Limit in General Relativity**: In Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity 
as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy, objects can never travel faster than the speed of 
light in any inertial frame (i.e., frames that are not accelerating or affected by gravitational fields).

5. **Experiments to Test Limits**: Scientists have conducted experiments at very high energies using particle 
accelerators like CERN's Large Hadron Collider. While particles like electrons and photons can be accelerated 
close to the speed of light, they never reach it in these environments.

6. **Aether Theories**: In the early days of physics (before special relativity), there were theories 
proposing a medium called "aether" through which light waves would travel. These theories have been largely 
discredited by experiments like Michelson-Morley and later ones, confirming that the speed of light is 
constant for all observers.

Understanding the speed of light is crucial in many areas of physics, including astronomy, astrophysics, 
particle physics, and even quantum mechanics. It continues to be a cornerstone in our understanding of the 
universe.
