## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is an important and fascinating constant in physics. Here are some key points about it:

1. **Value**: The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or about 670,616,629 miles per hour.

2. **Symbol and Notation**: It's often denoted by the letter \( c \).

3. **Invariance**: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their
relative motion or the motion of the source.

4. **Units**: In SI units (International System of Units), the speed of light defines the meter: One meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in a
vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

5. **Medium Dependence**: The speed of light can vary depending on the medium it travels through. In a medium such as water or glass, the speed of light is
slower than in a vacuum due to the interaction with the particles in the medium.

6. **Historical Context**: The first accurate measurement of the speed of light was made by Ole RÃ¸mer in 1675, using observations of Jupiter's satellites.
Modern measurements have refined this value significantly.

Understanding the speed of light is crucial not only for physics but also for various technological applications, including telecommunications and GPS
technology.
