## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
Here's a breakdown of the fascinating world of the speed of light:

**What is it?**

* **The Universal Speed Limit:**  Light travels at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second
(186,282 miles per second) in a vacuum. This value, denoted by the letter 'c', is a fundamental
constant in physics and applies to all inertial frames of reference.
* **The Constant that Never Sleeps:**  Light's speed isn't just faster than anything else - it's
the *absolute speed limit* within our universe. No object with mass can ever travel at or faster
than the speed of light.

**Why is this important?**

* **Fundamental to Physics:** The speed of light acts as a cornerstone for many theoretical and
practical aspects of physics:
    * **Electromagnetic Force:** Light's interaction with electric and magnetic fields forms the
basis of electromagnetism, responsible for everything from electricity to light itself.
    * **Relativity:** Albert Einstein's theory of relativity changed our understanding of time,
space, and gravity by showing how the speed of light is constant for all observers regardless of
their own motion (a fundamental principle known as 'special relativity').
    * **Cosmology:** The universe expands at a rate directly linked to the speed of light.

**How fast does it go?**

* **Faster than anything else!**  The speed of light is a universal constant, and nothing can
break this speed barrier, not even as tiny as an electron or proton. This makes it incredibly
difficult for us to fathom just how fast it travels, but we have instruments and technology to
measure and study its behavior.

**Interesting Facts about the Speed of Light:**

* **Light in a vacuum:**  It's fastest in a vacuum (a space free of matter) where there are no
"obstacles" to slow it down.
* **The Sunâ€™s Light:** When light from the sun reaches Earth, it takes approximately 8 minutes and
20 seconds to travel that distance.
* **Light Years:**  A year is the time it takes for light to reach us from a specific location in
space. This can vary depending on how far away the location is. One "light-year" is equal to one
million kilometers (621,371 miles).
