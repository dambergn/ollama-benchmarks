The speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted by the letter \( c \). In a vacuum, it travels at approximately 299,792,458 meters per second
(\( 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s), which is about 670 million miles per hour. This speed is the maximum at which information or matter can travel according to
Einstein's theory of relativity.

### Key Points:
1. **Constant in a Vacuum**: In a vacuum, light travels at \( c \). When passing through materials like air, water, or glass, its speed decreases due to
interactions with atoms.
2. **Einstein's Theory**: According to special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases, requiring infinite
energy to reach \( c \).
3. **Cosmic Significance**: Light from distant galaxies travels at \( c \), allowing us to observe them for billions of years.
4. **Applications**: The speed of light is crucial in fields like telecommunications (for signal speed), astronomy (for light-year measurements), and GPS
technology, where relativistic effects must be accounted for.

This constant plays a pivotal role in our understanding of the universe's structure and the limits of physical laws.
