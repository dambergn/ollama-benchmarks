## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second in vacuum or air (at standard
temperature and pressure). This fundamental constant has been measured to an accuracy of better
than a part in ten billion. The speed of light is so important because it serves as the basis for
our understanding of time dilation, relativity, and other phenomena in physics.
