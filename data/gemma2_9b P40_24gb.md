## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum, often denoted by the letter 'c', is a fundamental constant in physics. Here's 
what you need to know:

**Value:**

*  c = 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately 186,282 miles per second)

**Significance:**

* **Universal Speed Limit:**  Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This is a cornerstone of 
Einstein's theory of special relativity.
* **Time and Space Distortion:** As objects approach the speed of light, time slows down for them relative to 
observers at rest, and their length contracts in the direction of motion. These effects are known as time 
dilation and length contraction.
* **Electromagnetic Waves:** Light is an electromagnetic wave, which means it's a disturbance that travels 
through space as oscillating electric and magnetic fields. 

**Vacuum vs. Other Media:**

*  Light travels slightly slower when passing through materials like air or water. This difference in speed 
is called the refractive index of the material.

**Interesting Facts:**

* **Cosmic Distance:** The vast distances between stars and galaxies are measured in light-years, which 
represent the distance light travels in one year.
* **Communication:** Our current understanding of the universe relies on observing light that has traveled 
for billions of years. This allows us to study objects and phenomena from the distant past.


Let me know if you have any more specific questions about the speed of light!
