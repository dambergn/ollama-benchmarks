## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is one of the fundamental constants in physics and plays a crucial role in many areas of 
science, including cosmology, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. Here’s an overview of what the speed 
of light entails:

1. **Definition**: The speed of light is defined as the speed at which electromagnetic waves travel through 
empty space or a vacuum. This value is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 670,616,629 
miles per hour).

2. **Symbol and Value**: In scientific notation, it's commonly represented by the letter \(c\). The exact 
speed of light in a vacuum is defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s) according to the 
International System of Units.

3. **Historical Context**: Determining the speed of light has been a significant scientific endeavor for 
centuries. Early attempts by scientists like Galileo used lanterns and shutters but were limited by 
technology. It wasn't until the late 17th century that Danish astronomer Ole Rømer made one of the first 
credible estimates based on observations of Jupiter's moons.

4. **Special Relativity**: Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity posits that the speed of light is 
constant in all inertial frames of reference and that it serves as an absolute cosmic speed limit. No object 
with mass can travel at or beyond this speed, though photons (particles of light) can travel at \(c\) because 
they are massless.

5. **Impact on Time**: The constancy of the speed of light leads to phenomena like time dilation, where time 
appears to slow down for an object moving close to the speed of light relative to a stationary observer.

6. **Light in Different Mediums**: While light travels at \(c\) through a vacuum, its effective speed is 
reduced when it passes through materials such as air, water, or glass due to interactions with matter. This 
effect is described by Snell's law and leads to phenomena like refraction.

The speed of light is not only a physical constant but also serves as a cornerstone in our understanding of 
the universe and its fundamental laws.
