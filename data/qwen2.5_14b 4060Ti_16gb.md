## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,282 miles per second). This fundamental constant of physics plays
a crucial role in many areas of science and technology.

In a medium other than a perfect vacuum, such as air or water, the speed of light can be slower due to refraction. For example:

- In air (under standard conditions), the speed of light is slightly less but still very close to its value in a vacuum.
- In water, it decreases by about 25%, making it roughly 225,406 km/s.

The speed of light is denoted as "c" and is not only important for understanding electromagnetic phenomena such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible
light, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays but also plays a critical role in theories like Albert Einstein's special relativity. According to this
theory, the speed of light (in a vacuum) is constant regardless of the motion of the observer or source.

The finite speed of light means that there are limits on how fast information can travel through space, which has profound implications for our understanding
of causality and the nature of the universe. It also underpins many technologies we rely on today, such as GPS navigation systems, where precise measurements
of time delays based on the speed of light are used to determine locations accurately.

The constant c is so fundamental that it appears in numerous equations throughout physics and astronomy, making it one of the most important constants known
to science.
