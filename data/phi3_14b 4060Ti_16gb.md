## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light, denoted by 'c', is a fundamental physical constant that represents the maximum possible speed at which information or matter can travel
through space. It's approximately equal to 299,792 kilometers per second (or around 186,282 miles per second) in vacuum. The concept of light having a finite
speed challenged Newtonian physics and was a crucial factor leading up to the development of Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity.
The constancy of 'c' is an important aspect of many physical theories, including quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. Furthermore, it plays a significant
role in understanding space-time structure as described by Einstein's special and general theories of relativity.
