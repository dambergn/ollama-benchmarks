## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s), or about 670,616,629 
miles per hour (mi/h). This constant has been measured with extreme precision and is considered the 
fundamental speed limit for information transmission. The concept of light speed plays a crucial role in many 
fields of physics, including electromagnetism, optics, and cosmology.

Here are some key points about the speed of light:

1. **Theoretical Basis**: Albert Einstein's theory of relativity states that the speed of light is constant 
in all inertial frames of reference, regardless of the motion of the source or observer.
   
2. **Wave Speeds**: Light travels as both a wave and a particle (photons), but it can be most accurately 
described by its behavior as a transverse electromagnetic wave.

3. **Practical Implications**:
   - It helps in understanding phenomena like gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by 
some of the most violent events in the universe.
   - The speed of light influences time dilation and length contraction effects, particularly as observed 
from different inertial frames.
   
4. **Relativistic Effects**: At speeds close to that of light, relativistic effects become significant, 
affecting lengths and energies.

5. **Fundamental Constants**: It is part of the standard SI unit system for measuring velocity in physics.

Understanding the speed of light provides a fundamental link between space, time, matter, and energy, 
highlighting its importance across different scientific disciplines.
