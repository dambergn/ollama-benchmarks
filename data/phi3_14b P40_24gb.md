## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted as "c." It represents the maximum speed at 
which all conventional matter and information can travel through space. The value of c is exactly 299,792,458 
meters per second (approxime to three significant figures) in a vacuum.

This constant plays an essential role in many areas of physics including relativity theory where it defines 
the relationship between energy and mass (E=mc^2). It is also crucial for understanding how we perceive time, 
as moving objects experience time dilation - the faster you move, relative to light speed, the slower your 
clock appears to tick.

In practical terms, the finite speed of light means that when we look at distant stars and galaxies, we are 
actually seeing them as they were in the past because it takes time for their light to reach us. So, 
observing celestial objects is akin to looking back in time - an astronomer's window into history!
