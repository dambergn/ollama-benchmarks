## Prompt
```
Tell me about the speed of light.
```

## Response
```
The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s) in a vacuum. This value is determined through experimental measurements and has been
widely accepted by scientists since the late 19th century.
In special relativity, which describes how the laws of physics are consistent under different speeds, the speed of light in a vacuum is measured to be c =
299,792,458 meters per second. This value represents the maximum velocity at which light can travel according to common physical theories and experiments.
In general relativity, which describes how gravity is affected by mass and energy, the acceleration of light relative to observers who are accelerating or
moving at high speeds does not follow the same rules as in special relativity.
It's worth noting that measurements of the speed of light have been found to be slightly inconsistent over time. This discrepancy has led to ongoing
scientific debate about the best way to measure it and how to reconcile these differing measurements with general relativity.
